Pandas, short for "Panel Data", is an open-source library that offers high-level data structures and a vast array of tools for practical data analysis in Python. It has become synonymous with data wrangling, offering the DataFrame as its central data structure, which is effectively a table or a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).

To begin using Pandas, it's typically imported alongside NumPy, another key library for numerical computations. The conventional way to import Pandas is as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```
