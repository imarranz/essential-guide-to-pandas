# Real-World Case Studies: Titanic Dataset

## Description of the Data

This code loads the Titanic dataset directly from a publicly accessible URL into a Pandas DataFrame and prints the first few entries to get a preliminary view of the data and its structure. The `info()` function is then used to provide a concise summary of the DataFrame, detailing the non-null count and datatype for each column. This summary is invaluable for quickly identifying any missing data and understanding the data types present in each column, setting the stage for further data manipulation and analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd

# URL of the Titanic dataset CSV from the Seaborn GitHub repository
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv"

# Load the dataset from the URL directly into a Pandas DataFrame
titanic = pd.read_csv(url)

# Display the first few rows of the dataframe
print(titanic.head())

# Show a summary of the dataframe
print(titanic.info())
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This section generates statistical summaries for numerical columns using describe(), which provides a quick overview of central tendencies, dispersion, and shape of the datasetâ€™s distribution. Histograms and box plots are plotted to visualize the distribution of and detect outliers in numerical data. The `value_counts()` method gives a count of unique values for categorical variables, which helps in understanding the distribution of categorical data. The `pairplot()` function from Seaborn shows pairwise relationships in the dataset, colored by the 'Survived' column to see how variables correlate with survival.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Summary statistics for numeric columns
print(titanic.describe())

# Distribution of key categorical features
print(titanic['Survived'].value_counts())
print(titanic['Pclass'].value_counts())
print(titanic['Sex'].value_counts())

# Histograms for numerical columns
titanic.hist(bins=10, figsize=(10,7))
plt.show()

# Box plots to check for outliers
titanic.boxplot(column=['Age', 'Fare'])
plt.show()

# Pairplot to visualize the relationships between numerical variables
sns.pairplot(titanic.dropna(), hue = 'Survived')
plt.show()
```

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

This code checks for missing values and handles them by filling with median values for _Age_ and the mode for _Embarked_. It converts categorical data (_Sex_) into a numerical format suitable for modeling. Columns that are not necessary for the analysis are dropped to simplify the dataset.

```python
# Checking for missing values
print(titanic.isnull().sum())

# Filling missing values
titanic['Age'].fillna(titanic['Age'].median(), inplace = True)
titanic['Embarked'].fillna(titanic['Embarked'].mode()[0], inplace = True)

# Converting categorical columns to numeric
titanic['Sex'] = titanic['Sex'].map({'male': 0, 'female': 1})

# Dropping unnecessary columns
titanic.drop(['Cabin', 'Ticket', 'Name'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
```

## Survival Analysis

This segment examines survival rates by _class_ and _sex_. It uses `groupby()` to segment data followed by mean calculations to analyze survival rates. Results are visualized using bar plots to provide a clear visual comparison of survival rates across different groups.

```python
# Group data by survival and class
survival_rate = titanic.groupby('Pclass')['Survived'].mean()
print(survival_rate)

# Survival rate by sex
survival_sex = titanic.groupby('Sex')['Survived'].mean()
print(survival_sex)

# Visualization of survival rates
sns.barplot(x = 'Pclass', y = 'Survived', data=titanic)
plt.title('Survival Rates by Class')
plt.show()

sns.barplot(x = 'Sex', y = 'Survived', data=titanic)
plt.title('Survival Rates by Sex')
plt.show()
```

## Conclusions and Applications

The final section summarizes the key findings from the analysis, highlighting the influence of factors like _sex_ and _class_ on survival rates. It also discusses how the techniques applied can be used with other datasets to derive insights and support decision-making processes.

```python
# Summary of findings
print("Key Findings from the Titanic Dataset:")
print("1. Higher survival rates were observed among females and upper-class passengers.")
print("2. Age and fare prices also appeared to influence survival chances.")

# Discussion on applications
print("These analysis techniques can be applied to other datasets to uncover underlying patterns and improve decision-making.")
```
