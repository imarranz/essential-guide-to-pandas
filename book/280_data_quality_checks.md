# Data Quality Checks

Ensuring data quality is a critical step in any data analysis process. Data often comes with issues like missing values, incorrect formats, or outliers, which can significantly impact analysis results. Pandas provides tools to perform these checks efficiently. This chapter focuses on using assertions to validate data quality.

## Assert Statement for Data Validation

The `assert` statement in Python is an effective way to ensure that certain conditions are met in your data. It is used to perform sanity checks and can halt the program if the assertion fails, which is helpful in identifying data quality issues early in the data processing pipeline.

### Checking for Missing Values

One common check is to ensure that there are no missing values in your DataFrame. Here's how you can use an `assert` statement to verify that there are no missing values across the entire DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample DataFrame with possible missing values
data = {'col1': [1, 2, np.nan], 'col2': [4, np.nan, 6]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Assertion to check for missing values
try:
    assert df.notnull().all().all(), "There are missing values in the dataframe"
except AssertionError as e:
    print(e)
```

If the DataFrame contains missing values, the assertion fails, and the error message "There are missing values in the dataframe" is printed. If no missing values are present, the script continues without interruption.

This method of data validation helps in enforcing that data meets the expected quality standards before proceeding with further analysis, thus safeguarding against analysis based on faulty data.
